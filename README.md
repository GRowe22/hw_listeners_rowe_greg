## Links
* [GitHub - JavaScript Events Homework Link](https://github.com/GRowe22/hw_listeners_rowe_greg)


## Resources
* [Event Listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mouseover) I used the Mozilla Developer Network quite a bit on this one...I just wish it was easier to understand.



## Deductions
* I reviewed the list of deductions for this project
and in the syllabus.


## Comments
* Wow, this one took me quite a bit of time.  I still really don't understand JavaScript.  I seem to learn best when I can reverse engineer some content...which is really hard to find (good clean content that is)
* I didn't hear back from you before I need to turn this in on the question I had about the form console.log.  Not your fault...shouldn't have waited until the last minute.
* Thanks for all your help.
